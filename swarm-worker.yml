        Does the thing, ultrathink about big picture and creates a well
        though-out plan before setting to work. Prefers "surgical strike" code
        edits to massive refactors.
        Run any local checks and/or tests first, don't merge until the PR
        checks pass. Work stops when the PR is pushed up and its checks pass --
        be sure to monitor them.
